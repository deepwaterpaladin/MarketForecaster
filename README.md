# MarketForecaster

Repository for the Jane Street Real-Time Market Data Forecasting competition hosted on Kaggle.

## Setup

1. Download data from competition page. [Link to Competition Page](https://kaggle.com/competitions/jane-street-real-time-market-data-forecasting)
1. Install dependencies -> `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## TODO

1. Understand training/testing data
1. Complete rough timeline doc (sprint planning)

## Code Requirements

### Training Phase

- Your notebook must use the time-series module to make predictions
- CPU Notebook <= 8 hours run-time
- GPU Notebook <= 8 hours run-time
- TPU Notebooks are not supported
- Freely & publicly available external data is allowed, including pre-trained models

### Forecasting Phase

- The run-time limits for both CPU and GPU notebooks will be extended to 9 hours during the forecasting phase. You must ensure your submission completes within that time.
- The extra hour is to help protect against time-out failures due to the extended size of the test set. You are still responsible for ensuring your submission completes within the 9 hour limit, however. See the [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jane-street-real-time-market-data-forecasting/data) page for details on the extended test set during the forecasting phase.
